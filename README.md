# What is this boilerplate?
Instead of initialize all projects installing everything I decided to create this project with the structure that I like the most. 

## Techs
- Nuxt 3.5
- TailwindCSS
- Axios
- Pinia
- GSAP
- SASS

## Architecture
It uses the basic Nuxt 3.5 architecture and contains the folder "stores", where control the data states of the application and do the http requests using the axios plugin. After create a new store, you need to add it on "plugins -> stores.js"

## How to use
Download the ZIP, install the dependences with "yarn install / npm install", start the project "yarn dev/npm run dev". </br>
Tested with node 18
